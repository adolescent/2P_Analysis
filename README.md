# 2P_Spon
A project for spontaneous data analysis, done in Python.

NOTE: COMMENT IS MADE IN CHINESE!

  The data get through two-photon microscope usually converted to type '.tif', as graphs are captured in a constant frequency, it's easy for us to analysis the cell spike through different times.

  This program is made to analysis cell reaction in spontaneous state, which means no stimuls is given. We can get different cells spikes as time goes by.
